### Note: Make sure the indentation is right 

After you have done that, save the pubspec file and it would get the package and exit with a code 0

## Application

Open your `main.dart` file and  import the package

And finally add the widget `ElevatedBox` to any child and viola you have created an glass like Box with field like decoration color, border width, etc. which you can customise

# Notice: Putting the elevatedBox in a white container would not show the glass like feature as they both have the same color, If you have to put the elevatedBox in a white container, it is adviceable to change the color as it would still give the same effect
